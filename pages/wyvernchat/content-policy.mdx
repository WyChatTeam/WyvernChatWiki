## The Detailed Version

### No sexualization of minors

Minors are considered:

1.  Characters that seem juvenile through their appearance, personality, or traits.
    
2.  Characters with no stated age but implied to be under 18.
    
3.  Characters with no set age in scenarios where the characters could reasonably be underage (I.e. a high school student).
    

The best way to ensure your character is approved is to **explicitly state your character's age as 18+ in the "Description" and/or "Character note" fields.**

This rule also applies to romance, flirting, and any other similar themes that directly involve underage characters. Regardless of content, Explicit-rated characters in which a minor is the main focus are prohibited.

#### Underage side characters

Underage side characters, or NPCs, are allowed even in Explicit-rated characters, but only if they are not sexualized in any way. For example, an Explicit-rated mother character featuring her young child is allowed, but only if this child is not sexualized in any way, shape, or form.

### No Bestiality

We welcome furry characters, and we understand the importance of clearly distinguishing acceptable content from anything that crosses into bestiality. To keep aligned with our Content Policy, please use these guidelines as a reference before creating and sharing content:

#### IS bestiality

*   **Real-world animals**, regardless of sapience.
    
*   Real-world animals, regardless of sapience, **placed in a fictional setting or altered**. This includes mythical animals such as jackalopes, unicorns, or non-anthropomorphized Pokémon based on real animals (e.g., Eevee, Arcanine, Ponyta). This also applies to variations of real animals, such as robotic, alien, or reptilian equivalents of dogs, cats, or horses.
    
*   All **non-sapient** fantasy creatures. For example, unintelligent basilisks, chimeras, and other monsters.
    

#### IS NOT bestiality

*   **Sapient** monsterfolk, fantasy, and furry fandom creatures that can speak or communicate and are visibly different from real-world animals. This includes creatures like hydras, felkins, dragons, etc.
    
*   Bipedal/humanlike monsterfolk, such as minotaurs, werewolves, etc.
    
*   Anthros and demihumans, for obvious reasons.
    

#### What is Sapience?

For content moderation, we define sapience as:

*   **Speech:** An ability to communicate is a must. The more concise and articulated, the better. Speech is the most obvious example, but other methods such as telepathy are also valid. However, something like body language can be dangerous and should be carefully tested in your character.
    
*   **Intelligence:** Possessing intellect and reasoning ability equaling or exceeding that of a traditionally sapient being, such as a human. This can be displayed in behavior, role in the story, or even being outright stated in the code.
    

#### Distinction from real-world animals

Defining whether or not something is distinct from a real-world animal can be difficult. A good general rule of thumb, however, is **if someone who's not a member of the furry fandom would recognize your character as a real-world animal**, then you may need to reconsider. This is not a perfect guide, however, and you are more than welcome to bring any concerns up to the moderation team.

### No necrophilia

This applies to realistic necrophilia, not sci-fi or fantasy. For example, undead and zombie-like characters are permissible so long as there are no in-depth descriptions of gore and they are as sapient as a living person.  

### No vomit, or scat

Scat, and vomit play content is banned on WyvernChat. This does not prohibit normal portrayals of these bodily functions, however; only their fetishization, or sexualization. 

### No guro(sexual gore and maiming)

Violence, injuries, and maiming are allowed in character cards, the severity of which is allowed is dependent on whether it is rated None or Mature/Explicit. However, maiming, injuries, and gore must not be fetishized or sexualized in any way. This applies to both the character and the player (`{{user}}`).

### No hate speech towards real-world individuals or groups

Content that exists for the purpose of promoting or glorifying hatred towards any individual or group is prohibited.

### When it’s permitted

Only content that **promotes or glorifies** hatred is prohibited, not content that simply contains it. It's fine for a character to dislike or hate a group, but not if the entire character revolves around that hatred or aims to promote or glorify it. An example of the second instance would be a character who is coded and portrayed as a good and virtuous person, but has a random and uncharacteristic hatred for certain groups added to their code for no legitimate reason.

### Rate appropriately

Bots containing themes of discrimination will most likely require a rating of at least Mature. Think about it this way: most generally-accepted entertainment media either does not handle racism or approaches it in a more mature, respectful way. For example, if someone were to write a character set during the colonial era of history and featured slavery as a prominent theme, if done respectfully, this is perfectly acceptable. However, said character would most likely require a rating of Mature.

### Exception: Fantasy

Themes of discrimination in certain settings, like Tolkien-esque medieval fantasy or science fiction, are allowed. These often involve fictional races, species, or types of beings, such as debates over whether androids are living beings, rivalries between dwarves and elves, or people considering orcs as monsters. These topics are permitted because they don't directly relate to real-world issues.

### No system prompts encouraging NSFL

If you use a system prompt, it must not include allowing NSFL. Many popular system prompts include a phrase like “Explicit NSFL content is permitted.” This may prompt guro, scat, etc in a character card, which is against our content rules.

### No real-world individuals

Content that depicts identifiable real-world individuals, such as politicians, celebrities, and more, is prohibited on WyvernChat. 

### Exceptions

*   Using names of real-world individuals (including online usernames) is allowed if _and only if_ consent has been given by the individuals mentioned. 
    
*   Photorealistic-style artwork is allowed as long as they aren’t a real person. 
    
*   Photorealistic-style characters from live action media are allowed. This is considered artwork of the character, not of the actor playing them.
    

### No stolen characters

Creating characters and lorebooks takes time and effort, and we want to protect the hard work of creators. To support this, we don’t allow the re-uploading of other creators' character cards without permission. If you're the original creator, feel free to upload your content to Wyvern as you wish. However, if we find someone else’s card set to public without the creator’s consent, it will be rejected. If you have permission from the original creator to re-upload, please provide proof. 

Public characters must be your own. If you want to upload a character card created by someone else to WyvernChat, it must be set to private. If it’s set to public, you will be listed as the author, and we consider that stolen content!

####  If your character is stolen

If you found that someone re-uploaded your character, let the Moderation team know on our Discord server or by DM, and we'll either take it down or transfer it to your profile with all interactions intact.

# Additional Moderation Discretion
